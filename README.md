# First-Responder-Call-System
This project was designed in Java to aid in the sorting and submitting of calls through first-responder programs to more easily inform the required departments with what is needed, when, and how severe the situation is.

Project unfortunately never uploaded itself to github. I will slowly put in parts of the code and explain them in detail.  


Notification Class:
The notification class acts as a node class for the singly linked tree that I used later on. It contains the barebones for the entire project. Each notification contains it's own case number, time of arrival, required department, severity level, and distance.  While the distance is mainly for show, the other 4 parameters determine almost everything in the rest of the code.
