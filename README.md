# First-Responder-Call-System
This project was designed in Java to aid in the sorting and submitting of calls through first-responder programs to more easily inform the required departments with what is needed, when, and how severe the situation is.

Project unfortunately never uploaded itself to github. I will slowly put in parts of the code and explain them in detail.
